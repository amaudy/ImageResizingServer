Image Resizing Server
==================

This server provides a service to resize and crop images with a simple API. It's able to hold heavy loads and is easy to use.

It was written in Python, using Tornado web framework, Uwsgi to distribute the application on the network and Nginx front-end.

I want to specially thanks St√©phane Bunel (https://bitbucket.org/StephaneBunel), he was the initiator of this project, and advised me on how to re-develop this project for open-sourcing.

It's my first open-source project, feel free to contribute.

Installation
-----------

need sudo :

    apt-get install python-pip python-imaging nginx build-essential python-dev libxml2-dev && pip install uwsgi tornado
    cd /tmp && git clone https://github.com/noony/ImageResizingServer.git && cd ./ImageResizingServer
    python setup.py install
    
Attention if you haven't installed nginx you have to remove default conf in sites-enabled (rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default)
    

Configuration
-----------

You have to define your image clusters. It a simple dict in server.conf

Example : 

    clusterInfos = {
        'cluster1': 'url.cluster1.com',
        'cluster2': 'url.cluster2.com'
    }

You have to restart uwsgi after.

Examples
-----------
Resize an image to 100px width :

http://example.com/cluster1/100x0/path/to/image.png

Resize an image to 300px height :

http://example.com/cluster1/0x300/path/to/image.png

Resize an image to 600px width and change is quality to 60% :

http://example.com/cluster1/60/600x0/path/to/image.png

Crop an image and resize 200/200px :

http://example.com/cluster1/crop/200x200/path/to/image.png

Crop an image and resize 200/200px and change quality to 95% :
