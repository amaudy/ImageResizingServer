It's able to hold heavy loads and is easy to use.\r\n\r\nIt was written in Python, using Tornado web framework, Uwsgi to distribute the application on the network and Nginx front-end.\r\n\r\nI want to specially thanks St√©phane Bunel (https://bitbucket.org/StephaneBunel), he was the initiator of this project, and advised me on how to re-develop this project for open-sourcing.\r\n\r\nIt's my first open-source project, feel free to contribute.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nneed sudo :\r\n\r\n    apt-get install python-pip python-imaging nginx build-essential python-dev libxml2-dev && pip install uwsgi tornado\r\n    cd /tmp && git clone https://github.com/noony/ImageResizingServer.git && cd ./ImageResizingServer\r\n    python setup.py install\r\n    \r\nAttention if you haven't installed nginx you have to remove default conf in sites-enabled (rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default)\r\n    \r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nYou have to define your image clusters. It a simple dict in server.conf\r\n\r\nExample : \r\n\r\n    clusterInfos = {\r\n        'cluster1': 'url.cluster1.com',\r\n        'cluster2': 'url.cluster2.com'\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou have to restart uwsgi after.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n-----------\r\nResize an image to 100px width :\r\n\r\nhttp://example.com/cluster1/100x0/path/to/image.png\r\n\r\nResize an image to 300px height :\r\n\r\nhttp://example.com/cluster1/0x300/path/to/image.png\r\n\r\nResize an image to 600px width and change is quality to 60% :\r\n\r\nhttp://example.com/cluster1/60/600x0/path/to/image.png\r\n\r\nCrop an image and resize 200/200px :\r\n\r\nhttp://example.com/cluster1/crop/200x200/path/to/image.png\r\n\r\nCrop an image and resize 200/200px and change quality to 95% :\r\n\r\nhttp://example.com/cluster1/crop/95/200x200/path/to/image.png\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
